robotic arm movement

ROBOTIC ARM
The arm should be able to perform the following movements:


 


The algorithm should be able to describe the above movements as:
•	The "Base", or "Waist",  should turn the arm 360o, 
•	The "Shoulder", is the responsible for "raising or lowering" the arm vertically
•	The "Elbow" will make the arm "go forward or backward".
•	The "Claw" or "Gripper" works by opening or closing to "grab things." Approximately 60mm

The program will be uploaded to atmega328pu through Arduino board.
